= ATTRIBUTES:

= USAGE:
1. Import this recipe in your cookbooks
2. Modify recipes/default.rb and put your api key instead of the placeholder
3. Upload the new recipe via: knife cookbook upload dd-agent
4. Wait until chef-client runs on the target node (or trigger chef-client if you're impatient)

We are not making use of data bags in this recipe as it is unlikely
that you will have to have more than 1 api key.
